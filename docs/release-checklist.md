# Megle Release Checklist

This checklist drives a clean release of Megle from the master branch. The goal is a
demoable, packaged Windows desktop build plus the Web/Docker artifacts. Run it
end-to-end, in order. Anyone who is not the original author should be able to follow it.

## 1. Pre-release verification

Run from the repo root.

```bash
npm test
npm --workspace @megle/web run build
npm --workspace @megle/desktop run build
cargo build --release -p megle-core
```

Expected:

- `npm test` is green (structure + contracts + schema + typecheck + cargo test).
- Web build emits `apps/web/dist/` without TypeScript or Vite errors.
- Desktop build emits `apps/desktop/dist/main.js` and `apps/desktop/dist/preload.cjs`.
- `cargo build --release -p megle-core` produces `target/release/megle-core[.exe]`.

If any step fails, stop and fix before continuing. Never edit the contract or schema to
"fix" a check; update the implementation to match the contract.

## 2. Manual smoke

Run `npm run dev` and walk through every item in this list. Capture broken behavior
as a follow-up issue rather than patching during release prep.

- [ ] Add a 1k+ file root via the sidebar input or the folder picker.
- [ ] Scan completes; the Task Center shows succeeded scan and thumbnail tasks.
- [ ] Browse the folder tree and the media grid; switching folders re-scopes the grid.
- [ ] During an active scan, the current folder keeps disclosing usable rows; the clicked tile's first clear happens before the visible scope's first clear, and the visible scope's first clear happens before the ahead scope's first clear. Unopened background folders stay deferred until the explicit background request happens later.
- [ ] Preview switching is responsive — left/right neighbors prefetch.
- [ ] Rename / Move / Recycle work from the context menu; recent ops drawer updates.
- [ ] Tag / rate / favorite a file; search composes filters; chips clear filters.
- [ ] Cancel a running scan from Task Center; retry it; final state is succeeded.
- [ ] Disable / re-enable a registered plugin; the badge reflects state.
- [ ] Settings page shows ffmpeg badge, database path, and plugins folder path.
- [ ] Onboarding hero appears on a fresh profile (no roots) and "Choose folder" opens
      the native picker (or focuses the sidebar input in browser-only mode).
- [ ] Frameless chrome — minimize / maximize / close work; the topbar is draggable;
      window position and maximized state restore on next launch.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts behave: F2 rename, Delete recycle, Shift+Delete permanent
      delete, Ctrl+F focuses search, Esc clears selection.

### 2.1 Automated real-photo smoke (recommended)

Use this when you don't want to click through the smoke list manually. It exercises
the entire `Electron → Core → SQLite → thumbnail worker → preload bridge → React grid`
path against a real photo directory and reports the exact UI state via CDP.

```bash
# 1. Clean DB so we hit the cold-start path.
rm -rf .data

# 2. Launch dev with auto-add-root + Chrome DevTools Protocol port.
MEGLE_AUTO_ADD_ROOT="<absolute path to a real photo folder>" \
  MEGLE_REMOTE_DEBUG=1 \
  npm run dev

# 3. After the window opens, in another shell:
WS=$(curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:9222/json \
  | python -c "import json,sys; print([p for p in json.load(sys.stdin) if p['type']=='page'][0]['webSocketDebuggerUrl'])")
node tools/dev/cdp-inspect.mjs "$WS"
```

The CDP inspector prints a one-liner JSON: `hasBridge`, `coreUrl`, `hasToken`,
tile counts (`ready` / `loading` / `failed`), `<img>` element count, and the
sidebar's roots subtitle. A healthy run is `hasBridge: true`, `hasToken: true`,
non-zero `tiles_ready`, and an equal number of `imgs` (each ready tile renders
one real `<img class="tile-thumb-image">`).

If the inspector reports `hasBridge: false`, the preload script crashed — check
that `apps/desktop/dist/preload.cjs` exists and is loaded by the BrowserWindow.

### 2.2 Disclosure-scan real outputs benchmark

Run this smoke before release candidates that touch root scanning, folder
disclosure, thumbnail priority, or preview loading. It uses a clean temporary DB
and the real Stable Diffusion outputs directory by default:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types tools/dev/real-load-test.mts
```

Expected:

- The source directory is `G:\AI_Painter\stable-diffusion\stable-diffusion-webui\outputs`
  unless `MEGLE_REAL_LOAD_ROOT` overrides it.
- The script reports add-root to first visible media timing before scan
  completion when the real tree is large enough for an active-scan observation.
- Switching between media-bearing folders returns scoped media while the scan is
  still running, or logs a warning if the local scan completed too quickly.
- The script covers `selected`, `visible`, `ahead`, and `background` thumbnail
  priorities through `/media/:id/thumbnail?target=grid_320&priority=...` and
  reports first-clear and settled timings for the foreground scopes.
- The selected tile's first clear happens before the visible scope's first
  clear, and the visible scope's first clear happens before the ahead scope's
  first clear.
- The background folder has no ready thumbnails before the explicit background
  request is made, and its clear timing is measured only after that request.
- The script enqueues `/tasks/interactive-folder-scan` for the current folder
  and verifies that task succeeds with current-folder work recorded.
- The indexed media count must match the on-disk media count; any mismatch is a
  failure, not a warning.
- `/media/:id/preview` reports original media size and private cache headers,
  not the `db_blob` thumbnail path.

## 3. Release artifacts

1. Bump versions in lockstep:
   - `package.json` (root) — `version`
   - `apps/web/package.json` — `version`
   - `apps/desktop/package.json` — `version`
   - `crates/core/Cargo.toml` — `[package].version`
2. Commit the version bump:
   ```bash
   git add package.json apps/web/package.json apps/desktop/package.json crates/core/Cargo.toml
   git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
   ```
3. Tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Megle vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
4. Create a GitHub release on the new tag and upload the built artifacts:
   - `target/release/megle-core[.exe]`
   - `apps/desktop/dist/` packaged via `electron-builder` (or the chosen packager)
   - `apps/web/dist/` zipped for static hosting
5. Smoke the released artifacts on a clean Windows machine before announcing.

## 4. Post-release

- Update `docs/README.md` "Current Work" if the next phase changes scope.
- Open follow-up issues for items deferred during smoke testing.
- Reset the development branch to track the next milestone.
