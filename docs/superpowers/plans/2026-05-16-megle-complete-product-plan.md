# Megle Complete Product Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Integrate the approved UI foundation into the full Megle product roadmap and drive implementation through a complete Windows-first product, not just a shell or prototype.

**Architecture:** Keep the existing `Electron shell -> React UI -> Rust Core API -> SQLite/media pipeline` structure. Treat UI foundation as a prerequisite layer, then complete the browse path, preview path, task system, metadata/search, file operations, advanced media, plugins, Web/Docker reuse, and release hardening in sequence.

**Tech Stack:** Electron, React, TypeScript, Vite, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Lucide, TanStack Query, Zustand, Rust, Axum, SQLite, FFmpeg, libvips, process plugins.

**Modify During Coordination:**

- `D:/Megle/docs/implementation-roadmap.md`
- `D:/Megle/docs/README.md`
- `D:/Megle/.codex/memory.md`

**Verify With:**

- `npm test`

- phase-specific benchmark or manual acceptance steps from each child plan

### Task 1: Execute The UI Foundation First

**Files:**

- Modify: `D:/Megle/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-16-megle-ui-foundation.md`
- Modify: `D:/Megle/.codex/memory.md`
- Verify: `npm test`

- [x] **Step 1: Treat the UI foundation plan as the first implementation gate**

Use `D:/Megle/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-16-megle-ui-foundation.md` as the first executable slice.

- [x] **Step 2: Do not start feature-specific page polish before the shell is real**

Required UI baseline before Phase 2:

- frameless Electron desktop chrome
- shared `design-tokens` package
- shared `ui` package
- reusable `app-shell`
- Library / Settings / Plugins / Tasks page scaffolding

- [x] **Step 3: Verify the foundation slice**

Run:

```bash
npm test
npm --workspace @megle/web run build
npm --workspace @megle/desktop run build
```

Expected:

- foundation changes compile cleanly
- the repo checks still pass
- later phases can build on one design system instead of per-page CSS

- use the shared toolbar / sidebar / inspector / context menu shell

- [x] **Step 2: Keep UI and Core work coupled**

The Phase 2 child plan must cover both:

- Core scan/query endpoints
- UI workbench integration inside the shared shell

Acceptance target:

- a user can add a real root and browse a real directory in the designed UI

### Task 3: Integrate Thumbnail And Preview Quality Into The Product

**Files:**

The child plan must explicitly keep:

- glass on control layers
- stable dark content surfaces
- no layout shift on tile load
